# *Part 1: The Foundation of Reading – And Why a Name Matters*
Learning to read is one of the most complex and transformative processes a child will ever undertake. It’s not just about decoding letters and sounds — it’s about building the foundation for becoming a thoughtful, critical, and independent reader. The early stages of literacy are crucial. Without a strong foundation, later learning becomes a struggle, and the joy of reading may be lost before it ever truly begins.

That’s why early literacy must be intentional, meaningful, and grounded in both the child’s lived experiences and in evidence-based practices. One powerful — and often underestimated — strategy is using children’s own names as a starting point for literacy learning.

## Why start with a name?

A child’s name is much more than a word. It’s their identity, their first written label, and often the first word they recognize in print. This deep emotional connection makes it a uniquely stable and familiar “text” for young learners.

By working with proper names in the classroom, we tap into:

* Emotional engagement: Children are naturally curious and invested when the content is personal.
* Familiarity and repetition: Names are heard, spoken, and seen daily, making them high-frequency words in a child’s world.
* Motivation: Learning to read and write becomes exciting when the material feels relevant and affirming.

Using names can support important early literacy skills, including:

* Letter recognition and letter-sound correspondence: Names offer concrete examples of letters in meaningful contexts.
* Phonemic awareness: Breaking apart and manipulating the sounds in a familiar name strengthens sound awareness.
* Concepts of print: Names help children understand that print carries meaning and that letters are arranged in specific ways.

Among the many ways to support early readers, starting with a name offers a meaningful bridge between the known and the new. It personalizes the learning process and fosters a deeper, more authentic connection to reading.
