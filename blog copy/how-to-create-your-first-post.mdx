# How to Create Your First Blog Post

Welcome to the blog! This post will guide you through creating your first blog post for this website.

## Step 1: Create a New File

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `blog` folder. The filename will become part of the URL, so choose something descriptive and URL-friendly.

## Step 2: Add Frontmatter

Start your post with frontmatter containing metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
thumbnail: "/images/blog/your-image.jpg"
publishDate: "2024-01-15"
updateDate: "2024-01-20"  # optional
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---
```

## Step 3: Write Your Content

Write your content using Markdown or MDX syntax. You can include:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks
- Images
- And much more!

## Step 4: Build and Deploy

Run the build process to convert your post to a web page. The system will automatically generate a card for your post on the homepage.

Happy blogging!
