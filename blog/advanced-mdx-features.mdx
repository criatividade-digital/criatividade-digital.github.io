# Advanced MDX Features for Your Blog

MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown content, making your blog posts interactive and dynamic.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. This means you can import and use React components within your blog posts.

## Using Components in Posts

You can create reusable components and use them in your posts:

```jsx
import { Callout } from '../components/Callout'

<Callout type="info">
  This is an info callout that stands out from regular text!
</Callout>
```

## Code Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Interactive Elements

Since this is MDX, you can even include interactive elements and custom styling to make your posts engaging.

## Best Practices

- Keep frontmatter consistent across posts
- Use descriptive filenames
- Add relevant tags for better organization
- Include engaging thumbnails
- Write clear, scannable content

Start experimenting with MDX to create rich, interactive blog posts!
