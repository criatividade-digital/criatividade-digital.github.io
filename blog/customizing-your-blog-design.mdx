- **Desktop**: Multi-column card layout with larger images
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing and sizing
- **Mobile**: Single column with optimized touch targets

## Customizing Post Cards

The blog post cards on the homepage can be customized by modifying the CSS classes:

- `.blog-card`: Main card container
- `.blog-card-image`: Thumbnail image
- `.blog-card-content`: Text content area
- `.blog-card-tags`: Tag list styling

## Typography and Spacing

The blog uses a clean, readable typography system with:

- Proper heading hierarchy
- Comfortable line spacing
- Responsive font sizes
- Good contrast ratios

## Adding Your Own Styles

You can extend the styling by:

1. Adding custom CSS classes
2. Modifying the existing component styles
3. Using CSS custom properties for theming
4. Adding animations and transitions

## Color Scheme

The default color scheme uses modern, accessible colors that work well in both light and dark environments.

## Performance Considerations

The blog system is optimized for performance with:

- Lazy loading of images
- Minimal JavaScript
- Efficient CSS
- Fast build times

Experiment with different styles to make your blog unique!
